# CommentHierarchy by Me First Games
My Mission is to make Unity Prefabs and Scene easier to document and maintain for small and large teams.

This tool allows you to add comments to your hierarchy in your scenes and prefabs.
* Anything starting with the prefix "//" will automatically highlight as a green comment.
* Anything starting with the prefix "todo" will automatically highlight as purple. 
* Comments are automatically marked as EditorOnly
* Comment game objects are automatically stripped when you build your game.
* Empowers you to document your prefabs and scenes with NO performance cost.
* Lightweight, easy to use, and enhances the normal Unity Experience.
