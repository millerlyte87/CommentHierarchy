This tool allows you to add comments to your hierarchy in your scenes and prefabs.
* Anything starting with the prefix "//" will automatically highlight as a green comment.
* Anything starting with the prefix "todo" will automatically highlight as purple. 
* Comments are automatically marked as EditorOnly
* Comment game objects are automatically stripped when you build your game.
* Empowers you to document your prefabs and scenes with NO performance cost.
* Lightweight, easy to use, and enhances the normal Unity Experience.
